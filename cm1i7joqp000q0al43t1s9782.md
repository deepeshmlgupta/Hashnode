In this blog, we will learn how to containerize a Django Noters Application using Docker and deploy it on Amazon Web Services (AWS). This makes it easy to run your app anywhere and scale it as needed. Let's get started!

![](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1727288395971/cdf4aef1-49b1-4383-b7c3-fca574fe1059.png align="center")

### üß∞ What You‚Äôll Need

Before we begin, make sure you have these tools installed:

* ‚òÅÔ∏è **AWS Account**
    
* üêô **Git** (optional but useful)
    
* üê≥ **Docker Commands**
    
* üìÇ **GitHub Repository** for the app (optional, but in this blog, you‚Äôll get a GitHub repository for your convenience) üéâ
    

To make things easier, we‚Äôll provide a link to the GitHub repository containing the complete code for the Django To-Do app, so you can follow along or clone it directly to your machine!

### Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository

First, clone the Django To-Do app from the GitHub repository I‚Äôve prepared for you:

GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/deepeshmlgupta/Notes-Application/](https://github.com/deepeshmlgupta/Notes-Application/blob/main/Dockerfile)

```plaintext
git clone https://github.com/deepeshmlgupta/Notes-Application.git
```

Once cloned, move into the project folder:

```plaintext
cd Notes-Application
```

### Step 2: Create the Dockerfile üê≥

Now we‚Äôre going to create the **Dockerfile**, which tells Docker how to build and run our Django app.

1. **Create a Dockerfile**: In the root directory of your project (same folder as `manage.py`), create a file named `Dockerfile` (no file extension, just `Dockerfile`).
    
2. **Set Up the Base Image**: We need to use a Python image because our app is built in Django (which is Python-based). Add this to the Dockerfile:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Use Python 3.8 as the base image
    FROM python:3.9
    ```
    
    The `FROM` line tells Docker which base image to use. Here, we're using a lightweight version of Python.
    
3. **Set the Working Directory**: We now tell Docker where our app will live inside the container:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Set the working directory inside the container
    WORKDIR /deepesh
    ```
    
    This creates a folder `/deepesh` in the container where our code will be stored.
    
4. **Install Dependencies**: We need to install the Django app‚Äôs dependencies, so first, we‚Äôll copy the `requirements.txt` file (this file contains all Python packages) and then install the dependencies:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Copy the requirements file
    COPY requirements.txt .
    
    # Install the dependencies from the requirements file
    RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    
    The `COPY` command copies the `requirements.txt` file into the container. The `RUN` command installs the dependencies using `pip`.
    
5. **Copy the Application Code**: Now, we‚Äôll copy the rest of our Django app files into the container:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Copy all project files into the working directory
    COPY . .
    ```
    
6. **Expose the Container on Port 8000**: We need to expose port `8000` so the Django app can be accessed from outside the container:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Expose port 8000 for external access
    EXPOSE 8000
    ```
    
7. **Run the Django Development Server**: Finally, we tell Docker how to start the Django app when the container runs:
    
    ```plaintext
    # Command to run the Django app
    CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
    ```
    
    This command starts the Django development server on port `8000` and binds it to all IP addresses (`0.0.0.0`) so it can be accessed from outside the container

    .

### Step 3: Build and Test the Docker Container üèóÔ∏è

[N](https://github.com/your-repository/todoapp)ow that we have the Dockerfile ready, let‚Äôs build and run the container.

1. **Build the Docker Image**: In the terminal, run the following command in the project folder to build the image:
    
    ```plaintext
    docker build -t notes-app .
    ```
    
    The `-t` option allows you to name the image (`django-todo-app`), and the `.` tells Docker to use the current directory to build the image.
    
2. **Run the Docker Container**: Once the build is complete, you can run the container with this command:
    
    ```plaintext
    docker run -d -p 8000:8000 notes-app:latest
    ```
    
    The `-d` option runs the container in detached mode (in the background), and the `-p 8000:8000` option maps your local port `8000` to the container‚Äôs port `8000`.
    
3. **Test the App**: Before testing the app, make sure to open the inbound traffic access on port 8000 on your AWS EC2 instance.
    
    After setting the inbound rules, open your browser and go to `http://<your-ec2-public-ip>:8000`. You should see the Django To-Do app running! üéâ

4. After successfully following the above steps, your application should be running like this:

### Conclusion

And that‚Äôs it! üéä You‚Äôve successfully created a Dockerfile for your Django To-Do app. Now your app is packaged and ready to run anywhere using Docker. You can easily push the image to a cloud provider like AWS or share it with others.

For your convenience, here‚Äôs the link to the GitHub repository where you can find all the code: [GitHub Repo Link](https://github.com/deepeshmlgupta/Notes-Application/).

Happy coding! üöÄ
