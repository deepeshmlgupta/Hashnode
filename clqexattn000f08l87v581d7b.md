    Microsoft Azure, introduced by Microsoft Corporation in 2010, is the second-biggest cloud provider globally. It holds a 23% market share as of Q1 2023. Azure provides a variety of services, much like AWS, but it focuses on Windows-based computing and integrates seamlessly with other Microsoft services.
    
3. Google Cloud(GCP):
    
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP) was created by Google in 2011 and is the third-largest global cloud provider, holding a 9% market share as of Q1 2023.
