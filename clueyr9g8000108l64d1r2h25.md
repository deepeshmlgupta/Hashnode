## **Command to check present working directory?**

```plaintext
pwd
```

The command mentioned is used to find out which directory you are currently working in on Linux. It has a few options:

* `-L, --logical`: This uses the directory as it appears in your system, even if it's linked to another location.
    
* `-P, --physical`: This ignores any symbolic links and shows the actual directory.
    
* `--help`: It shows information on how to use the command.
    
* `--version`: It shows which version of the command you are using.
    

If you don't use any option, it behaves as if you used `-P`.

Keep in mind that depending on your specific command shell, there might be variations in how the `pwd` command works. Always check your shell's documentation for more details on what options are supported.

## Command to display all files and directories, including hidden ones?

```plaintext
ls 
ls -l 
ls -a 
ls -la
```

The `ls` command is utilized to list all files, while the `-la` flag expands this to include directories, along with hidden files.

* `-l`, `--long`: Provides a detailed listing.
    
* `-a`, `--shows hidden files and folders`: Reveals files and directories whose names begin with a dot, denoting them as hidden.
    

## Command for finding the content within a file?

The "cat" command displays the content contained within a file.

For instance, if we have a file named "demo.txt" with the text "Hello DevOps" inside, the command to view its content would be:

```plaintext
cat demo.txt
```
