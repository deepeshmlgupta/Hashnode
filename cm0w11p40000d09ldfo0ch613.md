Docker makes it easy to develop and run applications in isolated environments. In this blog, we'll show you how to install Docker on an Ubuntu EC2 instance in AWS. By the end, you'll have Docker up and running on your EC2 instance, ready to use.

## 1\. Setting Up an AWS EC2 Instance üîó

### Step 1: Launching an EC2 Instance

* Log in to your **AWS Management Console**.
    
* Go to the **EC2 Dashboard** and click "Launch Instance."
    
* Pick an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ‚Äì Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS is a great option.
    
* Select an Instance Type ‚Äì choose **t2.micro,** which is ***free tier eligible***.
    
* Set up your instance details, add storage, and include tags if you like.
    
* **Configure Security Group**: Allow **SSH (port 22)** to access your instance.
    
* Launch the instance and download the key pair (`.pem file`) for SSH access.
    

### Step 2: Connect to Your EC2 Instance

* Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your `.pem` key file is saved.
    
* Run the following command to connect to your EC2 instance:
    

```plaintext
ssh -i "your-key-file.pem" ubuntu@your-ec2-public-ip
```

Replace `your-key-file.pem` with the name of your key file and `your-ec2-public-ip` with the public IP address of your instance.

Once connected, you are ready to install Docker.

## 2\. Installing Docker on Ubuntu üêã

### Step 1: Update Your Ubuntu Package Repository

Before installing Docker, it‚Äôs essential to refresh the package index to ensure you‚Äôre working with the latest available versions. Execute the following commands:

```plaintext
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```

### Step 2: Install Docker

To install Docker, simply execute the following command in your terminal:

```plaintext
sudo apt-get install docker.io
```

### Step 3: Start and Enable Docker Service

To ensure Docker starts on boot, enable the Docker service and start it:

```plaintext
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

## 3\. Docker Commands üñ•Ô∏è

Now that Docker is installed, let's explore some essential Docker commands that you‚Äôll use regularly:

### 3.1 `docker ps`

The `docker ps` command displays all running containers. If you encounter a "permission denied" error when using this command, you can resolve it by running the command shown in the screenshot below.

```plaintext
docker ps
```

If you have not idea about the user the use command

```plaintext
whoami
```

In my case, since the user is `ubuntu`, you can directly use `ubuntu` in your command and run it. Alternatively, you can use `$USER` to automatically adjust the ownership permissions.

```plaintext
chown $USER /var/run/docker.sock
```

To list both running and stopped containers, use:

```plaintext
docker ps -a
```

### 3.2 `docker images`

The `docker images` command lists all the images downloaded on your system.

```plaintext
docker images
```

### 3.3 `docker stop`

The `docker stop` command stops a running container. You need to specify the container ID or name.

```plaintext
docker stop <container_id>
```

Example:

```plaintext
docker stop 2a68bbc66528
```

### 3.4 `docker rm`

The `docker rm` command removes a stopped container.

```plaintext
docker rm <container_id>
```

Example:

```plaintext
docker rm 2a68bbc66528
```

### 3.5 `docker rmi`

The `docker rmi` command removes a Docker image from your system.

```plaintext
docker rmi <image_id>
```

Example:

```plaintext
docker rmi 7e8b9c0d1e2f
```

### 3.6 `docker inspect`

The `docker inspect` command is used to view detailed information about a Docker container or image. It provides a JSON output that includes configuration settings, network settings, volumes, mounts, and more.

```plaintext
sudo docker inspect <container_id_or_image_id>
```

Example:

If you want to inspect a running container with ID `1a2b3c4d5e6f`, you would run:

```plaintext
sudo docker inspect 1a2b3c4d5e6f
```

### 3.7 `docker exec`

The `docker exec` command allows you to run commands inside a running container.

```plaintext
docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash
```

This opens a bash shell inside the container, allowing you to interact with it.

### 3.8 `docker top`

The `docker top` command shows the processes running inside a Docker container. It functions similarly to the `top` command in Linux but is specifically designed to display processes within a container.

```plaintext
sudo docker top <container_id>
```

Example:

If you want to see the running processes in a container with ID `1a2b3c4d5e6f`, you would run:

```plaintext
sudo docker top 1a2b3c4d5e6f
```

### 3.9 `docker save`

The `docker save` command is used to save one or more Docker images to a tar archive file. This is useful for backing up images or transferring them between systems.

```plaintext
sudo docker save -o <path_to_tar_file> <image_name_or_id>
```

Example:

If you want to save an image called `my_app:latest` to a tar file called `my_app_backup.tar`, you would run:

```plaintext
sudo docker save -o my_app_backup.tar my_app:latest
```

### 3.10 `docker load`

The `docker load` command is used to load Docker images from a tar archive file. It‚Äôs commonly used to restore images that were previously saved using `docker save`.

```plaintext
sudo docker load -i <path_to_tar_file>
```

Example:

If you want to load a Docker image from a tar file called `my_app_backup.tar`, you would run:

```plaintext
sudo docker load -i my_app_backup.tar
```

### Conclusion üìù

As I dive deeper into AWS and DevOps, I‚Äôm excited to share what I‚Äôve learned with you. In this expanded guide, we covered the installation of Docker and explored key commands used daily. These commands are vital for inspecting containers and images, managing processes within containers, and saving or transferring Docker images for backups.
