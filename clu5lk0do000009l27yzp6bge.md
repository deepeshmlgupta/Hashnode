## What is DevOps?

DevOps, which stands for Development and Operations, is like a partnership in creating and delivering software. ü§ù It involves developers and operations teams working together seamlessly to ensure a transition from coding to deploying applications.

## **Why DevOps is important?**

DevOps is all about getting things done quickly and smoothly by automating processes. It's like having your own personal assistant for deploying products. Plus, it helps make products scalable and cuts down on costs for the organization.

When it comes to actually putting DevOps into action, there are plenty of tools out there to choose from. Some of the most popular ones include:

1. Linux and Shell Scripting
    
2. Git and GitHub
    
3. Docker and Docker Swarm
    
4. Jenkins
    
5. Ansible
    
6. Kubernetes
    
7. YAML
    
8. Terraform
    
9. Grafana
    
10. Prometheus
    
11. Amazon Web Services (AWS)
    
12. Python
    

### Alright, let's break it down,

## What's automation?

Think of automation as using special tools to do boring, repetitive tasks in making software without human help.

## **What's scalability?**

Scalability is like making your system able to handle lots of users when it's super busy, and then calming down when things quiet down, all by itself.

## **What's Infrastructure?**

Infrastructure means managing servers using code, which is like organizing things in a smart way to make them work better.
