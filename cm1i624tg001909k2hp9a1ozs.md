In this blog, we will show you how to create a basic Docker project using [localhost](http://localhost).

### **üîç What is a Docker File?**

A Docker file is a simple text file that contains a series of instructions (steps) on how to build a Docker image. Think of it as a recipe for creating your application environment. It specifies everything from the base image to use, to what files to include, and how to configure your application. When you run the `docker build` command, Docker reads the Dockerfile and executes the instructions step-by-step to create a Docker image.

### **üõ†Ô∏è Why Use Docker files?**

* **Consistency:** Ensures your environment is the same across all stages of development, from testing to production.
    
* **Portability:** Makes it easy to share your application setup with others or deploy it on different machines.
    
* **Automation:** Automates the image creation process, reducing human error and saving time.
    

### **üìù Structure of a Docker file**

A Docker file consists of a sequence of instructions. Each instruction creates a layer in the Docker image. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of some common instructions:

1. `FROM`: Specifies the base image to start with. Every Docker file starts with this instruction.
    
    ```plaintext
     FROM ubuntu:20.04
    ```
    
    This line tells Docker to use the official Ubuntu 20.04 image as the base for your image.
    
2. `LABEL`: Adds metadata to your image, such as the author‚Äôs name or a description.
    
    ```plaintext
     LABEL maintainer="yourname@example.com"
    ```
    
3. `RUN`: Executes commands inside the container during the image build process. Commonly used to install software packages.
    
    ```plaintext
     RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3
    ```
    
4. `COPY` and `ADD`: Copies files from your host machine to the Docker image. `COPY` is straightforward, while `ADD` has additional features like extracting archives.
    
    ```plaintext
     COPY . /app
    ```
    
5. `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory inside the container. All subsequent instructions will be executed in this directory.
    
    ```plaintext
     WORKDIR /app
    ```
    
6. `EXPOSE`: Informs Docker that the container will listen on the specified network ports at runtime.
    
    ```plaintext
     EXPOSE 8080
    ```
    
7. `CMD`: Specifies the command to run when the container starts. Unlike `RUN`, which is executed during the build, `CMD` is executed when the container runs.
    
    ```plaintext
     CMD ["python3", "app.py"]
    ```
    
8. `ENTRYPOINT`: Similar to `CMD`, but with `ENTRYPOINT`, the command and parameters are not overridden if Docker is run with command-line arguments. It is typically used to define a default application to run.
    
    ```plaintext
     ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
    ```
    
9. `ENV`: Sets environment variables in the container.
    
    ```plaintext
     ENV APP_ENV=production
    ```
    

**Example of a Sample Docker File**

```plaintext
# Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Run pip to install dependencies
# (if you had a requirements.txt, you'd use that here)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Step 6: Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Step 7: Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

### **üñäÔ∏è Task: To create a Docker file for a simple web application and successfully run it**

**Step 1: Create Your Application** First, create a simple Python script. For example, [`app.py`](http://app.py/):

```plaintext
print("Hello, DevOps Enthusiast!")
```

**Step 2: Create a Docker file** In the same directory as your Python script, create a file named `Dockerfile` (no file extension).

**Step 3: Add Instructions to Your Dockerfile**

```plaintext
# Step 1: Use an official Python runtime as a base image
FROM python:3.8-slim-buster

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
COPY . /app

# Step 4: Run pip to install dependencies
# (if you had a requirements.txt, you'd use that here)
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Step 5: Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
EXPOSE 80

# Step 6: Define environment variable
ENV NAME World

# Step 7: Run app.py when the container launches
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

**Step 4: Build the Docker Image** Open your terminal, navigate to the directory containing your Docker file, and run the following command:

```plaintext
docker build -t hello-enthusiasts .
```

This command tells Docker to build an image with the tag `hello-enthusiasts` using the instructions in your Docker file.

**Step 5: Run Your Docker Container** After building the image, run it with:

```plaintext
docker run -p 4000:80 hello-enthusiasts
```

This will start a container from the `hello-enthusiasts` image and map port 80 in the container to port 4000 on your host machine. Navigate to [`http://localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000/) in your browser, and you should see the output from [`app.py`](http://app.py/).

### **üîç Tips for Writing Docker files**

* **Keep It Simple:** Avoid adding unnecessary layers to keep your image lightweight.
    
* **Use Multi-Stage Builds:** For complex applications, consider using multi-stage builds to reduce the final image size.
    
* **Leverage Official Images:** Always start with an official base image whenever possible to ensure security and stability.
    
* **Optimize** `RUN` Instructions: Combine multiple `RUN` commands into one to reduce the number of layers and minimize image size.
