Migrating a Docker volume between servers is a common task in cloud and DevOps environments, ensuring persistent container data is seamlessly transferred. This guide explains how to copy Docker volumes from one server to another using `scp`, a secure and efficient method for server migration.

## **Why Migrate Docker Volumes?**

In **DevOps** and **cloud computing**, migrating a server along with its Docker volumes is crucial when:

* **Upgrading infrastructure** (e.g., moving to a more powerful server).
    
* **Changing cloud providers** (e.g., AWS to Azure).
    
* **Creating backups** of critical data.
    
* **Scaling applications** by replicating environments.

## **Prerequisites for Docker Volume Migration**

Before proceeding, ensure you have:  
âœ” **Access to Both Servers**:

* **Old Server (Source)**: `34.225.255.81`
    
* **New Server (Destination)\`**  
    âœ” **SSH Key-Based Authentication**:
    
* Public SSH key of the new server added to the `authorized_keys` file on the old server.  
    âœ” **Sudo Privileges**:
    
* Required for accessing and copying `/var/lib/docker/volumes/`.

## **Step-by-Step Guide to Copy Docker Volumes Between Servers**

### **1\. Generate SSH Key on the New Server (If Not Already Done)**

Run this command on the new server:

```plaintext
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
```

This generates a key pair in `~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

---

### **2\. Add SSH Key to the Old Server for Secure Access**

Copy the public SSH key to the old server using:

```plaintext
ssh-copy-id azureuser@34.225.255.81
```

Alternatively, use:

```plaintext
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh azureuser@34.225.255.81 "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

This enables **passwordless authentication**, improving security and automation in DevOps workflows.

---

### **3\. Copy Docker Volume Using SCP**

On the **new server**, run:

```plaintext
scp -r azureuser@34.225.255.81:/var/lib/docker/volumes/azureuser_mysql-data .
```

**Explanation:**

* `scp -r`: Recursively copies directories.
    
* `azureuser@34.225.255.81:/var/lib/docker/volumes/azureuser_mysql-data`: Source volume directory.
    
* `.` : Destination (current directory) on the new server.
    

To place it directly in `/var/lib/docker/volumes/` on the new server, use:

```plaintext
scp -r azureuser@34.225.255.81:/var/lib/docker/volumes/azureuser_mysql-data /var/lib/docker/volumes/
```

---

### **4\. Set Correct Permissions on the New Server**

After copying, update ownership and restart Docker to recognize the volume:

```plaintext
sudo chown -R root:docker /var/lib/docker/volumes/azureuser_mysql-data
sudo systemctl restart docker
```

This ensures the volume is accessible to containers in the **DevOps pipeline**.

---

### **5\. Verify the Migrated Docker Volume**

List the Docker volumes on the **new server**:

```plaintext
docker volume ls
```

Run a container to check if the volume data is intact:

```plaintext
docker run --rm -v azureuser_mysql-data:/data busybox ls /data
```

If files are listed, the migration was successful.

---

## **Conclusion**

Migrating a **Docker volume** between servers is essential in **DevOps**, **cloud computing**, and **infrastructure scaling**. By leveraging `scp` and SSH key-based authentication, you can efficiently move persistent data between environments with minimal downtime.

For automated DevOps workflows, consider integrating **Ansible** or **Terraform** for seamless infrastructure migration. ðŸš€
